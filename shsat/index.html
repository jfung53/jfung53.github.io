                        <p class="intro-text">Every October, 1/3 of all NYC 8th graders take the SHSAT admissions test to try for a seat at one of the city's eight Specialized High Schools (SHS).  Racial categories have been well-discussed.  Are there other demographics that intersect? </p>

                        <p class="intro-text">The answer: yes, definitely.  A school's poverty rate predicts fewer test takers <em>(p < 0.001).</em></p>

                        <h3 class="section-title">Methodology</h3>

                        <div class="body-text">
                            <p>I looked at the 2024 SHSAT admissions outcomes and the 2023-24 demographic snapshot of the 673 public middle schools in NYC.  The demographics I analyzed, as recorded by the Department of Education:  gender, poverty rate, english language learners (ELL), students with disabilities (SWD), and race (Asian, Black, White, Native American, Hispanic, and multi-racial).  </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>To predict outcomes I fit a forward stepwise multiple regression model using the olsrr package in R.  </p>
                        </div>

                        <h3 class="section-title">Limitations</h3>

                        <div class="body-text">
                            <p>Some predictors could only be discerned <strong>at the middle school level</strong>, but data at the student level would be more meaningful.  </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>Also, variations in <strong>economic hardship within a racial category</strong> can't be discerned with this data, so these results obscure the many lived experiences of individual students.  </p>
                        </div>

                        <h3 class="section-title">Results</h3>

                        <div class="image-with-caption">
                            <div class="image-frame">

                        <div class="intro-text">
                            <p>A middle school's poverty rate shows the most significant effects on predicting how many students per middle school sit take the SHSAT.  </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>Again, data at the student level would be more useful.  Regardless, it's difficult to argue that admissions via SHSAT is inherently fair when there are multiple demographics that can predict test taking rates.  </p>
