                            <p>Since 2017, the number of school shootings per year has more than tripled compared to previous decades.  </p>

                            <p>I was curious about where this is happening.  I could not find a map of school shooting incidents that is normalized by population density, so I made one.  </p>

It includes a detailed list of over 3000 shooting incidents, which I compared to similar datasets from the <a href="https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-school-shootings" target="_blank">Washington Post</a> and the <a href="https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/" target="_blank">Gun Violence Archive</a> to rule out any data collection biases.  </p>

                            <p>These movements have conglomerated into a loose network called the <strong>Manosphere</strong>.  It includes online communities, forums, subreddits, influencers, podcasters, and streamers who have often been linked with online harassment and violence in the real world, as well as extremist political organizations. Analysis of these movements has shown that the newer communities (Incels, Men Going Their Own Way, and The Red Pill) are far more toxic and misogynistic than the older ones (<span class="underline">Ribeiro et al., 2021</span>). </p>

                        <p class="body-text">To find out where people are Googling these topics, I whittled down a list of terms and websites using replication data from a study, The Manosphere and Politics (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/00104140241312095" target="_blank">Barnes & Karim, 2025</a>), and entered as many as possible into the Google Trends tool.  </p>

                        <p class="body-text">Google Trends <a href="https://medium.com/google-news-lab/what-is-google-trends-data-and-what-does-it-mean-b48f07342ee8" target="_blank">normalizes each search term</a> and indexes the results from 0 to 100, where 100 is the maximum search  interest for the time and location selected.  Spikes in the data represent an acceleration in popularity, relative search interest in the topic compared with itself.</p>

                        <p class="body-text">Interestingly, many of the keywords did not have sufficient data.  This might be because of the fringe nature of extremist groups.  I settled on a handful of topics, one for each Manosphere category, that had the best quality data for popularity.  </p>

                        <h3 class="section-title">Results</h3>

                        <p class="body-text">The results were <strong>not</strong> what I expected. As if I had tried to mix oil and  water, search interest hot spots seemed to be avoiding areas with higher rates of school shootings.</p>

                        <h3 class="section-title">Interpretations</h3>

                        <div class="body-text">
                            <p>I had to accept the null hypothesis: that there are no spatial relationships to be found.  </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>However, a <strong>secondary hypothesis</strong> had emerged: that there may actually be a correlation but with <strong>cold spots</strong>, not hot spots.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>To understand this I needed to correct how I was <strong>interpreting popularity on Google Trends</strong>.  These hot spots, or spikes, are markers of acceleration of search interest in a topic.  According to <a href="https://medium.com/google-news-lab/what-is-google-trends-data-and-what-does-it-mean-b48f07342ee8" target="_blank">this explanatory article by Simon Rogers</a>, a data journalist at Google, they are often a reflection of what's going on in the world.  The hot spots are <strong>reactions</strong> to a topic that entered the public consciousness, via the news, for example, but I had been considering them as spikes in the activity of the topic itself. What these maps may demonstrate is spikes of interest in areas where these concepts are making headlines and internet users are compelled to <strong>learn more</strong>. The partisan nature of news in America may also explain where the spikes are taking place.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>So what is the relationship between the Manosphere and school shootings? </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>While it may be easy to visualize a connection between school violence the dangerous ideas promoted by Manosphere figures, I am not suggested causality. Millions of viewers  may be drawn to these ideologies, but most of them are not committing  violent acts. Rather, maybe it points to the wider problem of a state-advocated hegemonic toxic masculinity that rejects the idea of  gender pluralism, takes pride in homophobia, and is supported by movements and people who use violence and harassment to solve problems.  This hegemony "staunchly enforces heterosexuality as the only acceptable form" of masculinity and "operates as an ideal that few, if  any, men can realistically attain" (<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0760/5/2/18" target="_blank">Schmitz and Kazyak, 2016</a>), carving pathways in the direction towards harmful online communities that purport to help men.</p>

                            <p>First, I'd like to calculate the correlation coefficients between Trends cold spots and higher rates of school shootings, as there does appear to be a relationship there.  </p>

                            <p>Second, it was suggested that I find DNS location data for Manosphere website visitors, but this kind of data is not readily accessible for privacy reasons.</p>

                            <p>Next, I'd like to add data about gun laws across the country, since an abundance of firearms is another very American problem.</p>
